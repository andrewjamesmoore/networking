## Layer 3: Network Layer

*   **Function:** Handles routing of data packets across networks. It determines the best path to send data from source to destination.

*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **IP Addressing:** Assigns unique addresses to devices on the network.
    *   **Routing:** Determines the best path for data to travel.
    *   **Fragmentation:** Divides large packets into smaller fragments for transmission.

*   **Protocols & Examples:**

    | Protocol | Description                                                                                                     | Example Use Case                                                                                                                                         |

    | IP       | Internet Protocol; provides logical addressing for devices on a network.                                         | Routing data packets across the internet.                                                                                                                |
    | ICMP     | Internet Control Message Protocol; used for error reporting and network diagnostics.                               | Using "ping" command to test network connectivity.                                                                                                      |
    | ARP      | Address Resolution Protocol; translates IP addresses into MAC addresses.                                         | Determining the MAC address associated with a given IP address on a local network.                                                                    |
    | NAT      | Network Address Translation; allows devices with private IP addresses to communicate with the internet.          | Allowing multiple devices on a home network to share a single public IP address.                                                                        |
